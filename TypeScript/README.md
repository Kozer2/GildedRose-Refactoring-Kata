# Gilded Rose

This is my attempt at the Gilded Rose Kata using TypeScript. I had never done TypeScript before, nor had I ever gotten the chance to refactor code like this. 
I greatly enjoyed writing my tests to start to check if everythign was passing and then beginging to refactor the code in small ways. Once I was comfortable that my changes were 
breaking anything, I turned my sights to write several helper functions to break up the if/else block. Once these were in place and my tests still passing, I added the functionality 
for conjured items stated in the Kata. 

Overall I enjoyed working on this kata as a challenge.
